MVP is LIVE! \r\n\r\nWe will merge our own proprietary data with many of the worldâ€™s largest databases ranging from government data, industry-specific data, voting records, business to business data, property data, credit bureau data, etc. to create a comprehensive variety of data sets valuable to individuals and businesses looking to both attract and retain clients.\r\n\r\nAs a result of our platform, all participants will be able to obtain the exact, nuanced data they are seeking.
